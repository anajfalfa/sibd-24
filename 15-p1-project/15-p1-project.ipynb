    "#### 1. Proposed database design\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The E-R model describing our proposed database design is represented below.\n",
    "Our database design includes the entities Doctor, Client, and Assistant. Despite sharing several attributes, we chose not to generalize them into a super-entity (e.g., \"Person\"). This decision is grounded in their unique identifiers: OMV for Doctor and TIN for Client. The Assistant is identified by their phone number, a choice justified by its inherent uniqueness. Additionally, the biographic description of each doctor was marked as unique, as identical descriptions could indicate potential plagiarism - no doctor has the exact same description and it would be very suspicious if two doctors wrote the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entity Owner was not created separately. Owners lack a distinct identifier and are instead tightly coupled with their animals. Since each animal has a single, specific owner (though an owner may have multiple pets), we included the owner's name as part of the primary key for the Animal entity. To ensure uniqueness, we assumed no owner would give two pets the exact same name. \n",
    "Instead of tracking an animal's age, we opted for a birthdate attribute, eliminating the need for annual updates.\n",
    "For the animal’s weight, we introduced the attribute weight_g (representing the most recent weight measurement in grams). This numeric field has a precision of 9 digits and a scale of 3, accommodating weights up to 999,999.999 grams and aligning with the sensitivity of precision scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though cats and dogs could be a specialization of mammals (as the text implies), we decided to specialize animals this way because all other animals except cats and dogs are identified by a common attribute (species), while cats and dogs are identified by their breed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Veterinary Visit entity was modeled as a weak entity dependent on Animal. This design leverages the animal's primary key as part of the foreign keys for Veterinary Visit, aligning with the rule that an animal cannot have multiple visits simultaneously. The participation and cardinality constraints are designed according to the description of the Veterinary Visit, with mandatory and single doctor, client and animal.\n",
    "SOAP Notes were not modeled as a separate entity due to the lack of a clear unique identifier. Instead, they are optional attributes of the Veterinary Visit, reflected in the SQL implementation by omitting the NOT NULL constraint.\n",
    "Prescriptions were modeled to occur only if a Veterinary Visit includes at least one Diagnostic. To represent this, we aggregated the association between Veterinary Visit and Diagnostic into a higher-level association (instead of making a ternary association with an Integrity Constraint). This aggregation allows the optional relationship between the Prescription and its associated entities while maintaining the integrity of the diagnostic-prescription dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Medication entity was set as a weak entity of Prescription, since it was described as an attribute with several attributes of its own. In addition to its attributes (name, dosage), the laboratory name was added as part of the primary key to distinguish between medications with the same name – not all names of medications are trademarks (e.g., generic drugs like Fenbendazole).\n",
    "For the Procedure entity, the “small textual description” was used as the unique identifier, even though it is not ideal. Making it a weak entity of Veterinary Visit would lead to an overly complex primary key, which we aimed to avoid. Procedures act as super-entities for further specializations, which helps maintain a clean structure.\n",
    "The Measurement entity was modeled as a weak entity of Test, leveraging the description (inherited from Procedure) and indicator as a composite primary key. This assumes that a single test can yield multiple unique measurements but never duplicate the same indicator.\n"
